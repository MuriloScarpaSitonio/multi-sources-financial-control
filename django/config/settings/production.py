# For sites that should only be accessed over HTTPS, you can instruct modern browsers
# to refuse to connect to your domain name via an insecure connection (for a given period of time)
#  by setting the “Strict-Transport-Security” header. This reduces your exposure to some
# SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
# SecurityMiddleware will set this header for you on all HTTPS responses if you set the
# SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting to a non-zero integer value. When enabling HSTS, it’s a good idea to
# first use a small value for testing, for example, SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 3600 for one hour.
# Each time a Web browser sees the HSTS header from your site, it will refuse to communicate
# non-securely (using HTTP) with your domain for the given period of time. Once you confirm that
# all assets are served securely on your site (i.e. HSTS didn’t break anything), it’s a good idea
# to increase this value so that infrequent visitors will be protected
# (31536000 seconds, i.e. 1 year, is common).
